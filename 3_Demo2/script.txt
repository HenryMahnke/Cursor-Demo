PrototypeCDPR... is a very common output that we get from our motion capture system where we have a bunch of header data 
and then actual data such as what frame it was taken in where it samples at 100 hz, and then what units things are in 

So say we just want to plot that data and see it in space to make sure that visually everything checks out, 
but lets say that in the future we are going to compare it to some data that we collect from the robot, 
but that gets collected at 10hz(Yikes! may need to get a better robot). But for this demo, we will downsample by 10 


All in, we know that we need to downsample from 100hz to 10hz, and that we want to plot the 3d trajectory with matplotlib 
(like normal plot in matlab... if you're one of those people...)
