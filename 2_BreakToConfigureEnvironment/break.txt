#configuring the privacy settings 


#privacy is important! 

#if you allow AI (chatGPT, claude, grok) to have access to your data (through normal chat interfaces) 
#there is a guarantee that they will train on your data. Even recently, temporary chats - the incognito mode for AI
#chatbots has come under fire and no longer appears to be private. 

Cursor on the other hand, is SOC2 compliant, and unless you let them, they don't allow the model providers to train on your data 
Nor do they train on your data for their internal models (like cursor tab, and cursor-small)
