Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm, and is one of the first ones learned in beginning computer science classes 
The idea is simple. Compare every 2 elements in a left to right fashion. If the left one is greater than the right, swap em!
Otherwise, don't swap them, make your left element the right element, and make the right element the right + 1 element
